PROJECT TITLE:
Blockcam smart contract on Aptos Blockchain

Project Description:
The BlockCam Smart Contract is a decentralized application (dApp) built using the Move programming language and deployed on the Aptos blockchain.BlockCam is an innovative security solution that leverages blockchain technology to secure and audit CCTV footage. By employing an immutable ledger, BlockCam ensures the integrity of video data, making it resistant to tampering and unauthorized access. This solution is ideal for organizations that require reliable and verifiable surveillance records, offering a higher level of trust and transparency in video monitoring systems.

Key Features:
Blockchain Security:Securely stores CCTV footage on a tamper-proof blockchain.
Immutable Ledger:Creates an unchangeable audit trail with time-stamped, cryptographically hashed footage.
Tamper Detection:Real-time alerts for unauthorized access or data tampering.
Scalable Integration:Compatible with existing CCTV systems; supports various camera types and formats.
Access Control:Restricts access using cryptographic keys; supports role-based permissions.


Project Vision:
BlockCam aims to revolutionize the security industry by introducing an unparalleled level of trust and integrity into CCTV surveillance. By leveraging the power of blockchain, BlockCam not only secures video footage but also enhances transparency and accountability in security operations. Our vision is to establish BlockCam as the gold standard for surveillance systems in industries where data integrity is critical, such as law enforcement, financial institutions, and public infrastructure. We aspire to create a world where video evidence is not only secure but also indisputable, empowering organizations to protect their assets and ensure public safety withÂ confidence.
